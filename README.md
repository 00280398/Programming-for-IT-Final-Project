# Programming-for-IT-Final-Project

Nick Wunderlich

This project is to be a randomly generated math test. The user will choose what type of test they want (addition, subtraction, multipliction, division) (if applicable). The numbers for each of the 15-20 questions will be randomly generated; depending on the type of test chosen, the numbers will have a specified range. At the end of the test, the user will recieve a score showing how many they got right.
